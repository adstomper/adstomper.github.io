            <p>Current Adblock Edge versions allow you to "tweak" your filters
              in many different ways. This document explains the choices that
              you have and how they can be used.</p>
            <p><em>Disclaimer</em>: All filter examples given here are really
              only examples and are not meant to be used.</p>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Adblock Edge filters</h2>
            <p>The options described in this section should be enough for users
              who have to create a filter occasionally.</p>
            <h3 id="basic">Basic filter rules</h3>
            <p>The most trivial filter you can define is of course the address
              of banner you want to block. However, often this address changes
              every time you open a page. For example it could be <code>http://example.com/ads/banner123.gif</code>
              where 123 is a random number. Here blocking the complete address
              won't help you, you need a more general filter &#8212; like <code>http://example.com/ads/banner*.gif</code>.
              Or maybe even <code>http://example.com/ads/*</code>.</p>
            <p><em>Note</em>: Make sure that you are not replacing too much by
              wildcards. The filter <code>http://example.com/*</code> will
              definitely block all banners but it will also block everything
              else from example.com that you still might want to see.</p>
            <h3 id="whitelist">Defining exception rules</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you will notice that one of your filters that is
              usually working quite well blocks in some case blocks something
              that it shouldn't be blocking. You don't want to remove this
              filter but you still don't want it to match in this one case.</p>
            <p>That's what exception rules are good for &#8212; they allow you to
              define cases where filters shouldn't be applied. For example if
              you are unhappy with your filter <code>adv</code> blocking <code>http://example.com/advice.html</code>,
              you can define an exception rule <code>@@advice</code>. Exception
              rules are no different from filter rules, you can use wildcards or
              regular expressions. You only have to precede them by <code>@@</code>
              to indicate an exception rule.</p>
            <p>Exception rules can do more. If an exception rule starts with
              http:// or https:// (optionally with a pipe before it) it will
              make whole pages an exception. For example, if your exception rule
              is <code>@@|http://example.com</code> and you open some page from
              example.com &#8212; Adblock Edge will be entirely disabled on this page
              and nothing will be blocked.</p>
            <h3 id="anchors">Matching at beginning/end of an address</h3>
            <p>Usually Adblock Edge treats every filter as if it had a wildcard
              at its beginning and end, e.g. there is not difference between the
              filters <code>ad</code> and <code>*ad*</code>. While this is
              usually unproblematic, sometimes you wish that the filter you
              defined only matches at the beginning or end of an address. For
              example you might want to block all Flash, but if you add the
              filter <code>swf</code> the address <code>http://example.com/swf/index.html</code>
              will also be blocked.</p>
            <p>Solution to this problem: add a pipe symbol to the filter to show
              that there should be definitely the end of the address at this
              point. For example the filter <code>swf|</code> will block <code>http://example.com/annoyingflash.swf</code>
              but not <code>http://example.com/swf/index.html</code>. And the
              filter <code>|http://baddomain.example/</code> will block <code>http://baddomain.example/banner.gif</code>
              but not <code>http://gooddomain.example/analyze?http://baddomain.example</code>.</p>
            <p id="flexible-anchors">Sometimes one wants to block <code>http://example.com/banner.gif</code>
              as well as <code>https://example.com/banner.gif</code> and <code>http://www.example.com/banner.gif</code>.
              This can be achieved by putting two pipe symbols in front of the
              filter which makes sure the filter matches at the beginning of the
              domain name: <code>||example.com/banner.gif</code> will block all
              these addresses while not blocking <code>http://badexample.com/banner.gif</code>
              or <code>http://gooddomain.example/analyze?http://example.com/banner.gif</code>
              .</p>
            <h3 id="separators">Marking separator characters</h3>
            <p>Often you need to accept any separator character in a filter. For
              example, you might write a filter that blocks <code>http://example.com/</code>
              and <code>http://example.com:8000/</code> but not <code>http://example.com.ar/</code>.
              Here the symbol ^ can be used as a placeholder for a single
              separator character: <code>http://example.com^</code> .</p>
            <p>Separator character is anything but a letter, a digit, or one of
              the following: _ - . %. The end of the address is also accepted as
              separator. In the following example all separator characters are
              shown in red: http:<b style="color: red;">//</b>example.com<b style="color: red;">:</b>8000<b
                style="color: red;">/</b>foo.bar<b style="color: red;">?</b>a<b
                style="color: red;">=</b>12<b style="color: red;">&amp;</b>b<b style="color: red;">=</b>%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82.
              So this address can be blocked with the filter <code>^example.com^</code>
              or <code>^%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82^</code> or <code>^foo.bar^</code>.</p>
            <h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
            <p>Any rule that starts with an exclamation mark is considered a
              comment. It will still show up in the filter list but in grey
              instead of black. Adblock Edge will ignore this rule for actual
              blocking so it is safe to write there whatever you want. You can
              place a comment rule above a real filter to describe what it is
              doing. Or you can put a comment on top of your filter list stating
              your authorship (most filter list authors do that).</p>
            <h4 id="special-comments">Special comments</h4>
            <p> Special comments will only have an effect in downloaded filter
              lists, not in custom filters. They can set a number of parameters
              for the filter list: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p> <code>! Homepage: http://example.com/</code> </p>
                <p> This comment determines which webpage should be linked as
                  filter list homepage. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <code>! Title: FooList</code> </p>
                <p> This comment sets a fixed title for the filter list. If this
                  comment is present the user will no longer be able to change
                  the title. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <code>! Expires: 5 days</code> </p>
                <p> This comment sets the update interval for the filter list,
                  the value can be given in days (e.g. <code>5 days</code>) or
                  hours (e.g. <code>8 hours</code>). Any value between 1 hour
                  and 14 days is possible. Note that the update will not
                  necessarily happen after this time interval. The actual update
                  time is slightly randomized and depends on some additional
                  factors to reduce server load. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <code>! Checksum: OaopkIiiAl77sSHk/VAWDA</code> </p>
                <p> This comment makes sure that accidental corruption of the
                  data won't result in broken filters. For example, some
                  firewall software might modify the filter <code>*/adnetwork/*</code>
                  on download in an attempt to protect the user against ads. It
                  will remove part of the filter so that Adblock Edge will only
                  see the filter <code>**</code>. A checksum comment in the
                  filter list protects against this scenario, any modifications
                  will have the result that the checksum no longer matches and
                  Adblock Edge will ignore the data. </p>
                <p> To calculate the checksum the following steps need to be
                  performed: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Remove the existing checksum comment if any.</li>
                  <li>Encode filter list text using UTF-8 encoding.</li>
                  <li>Convert all line breaks to Unix style (replace <code>\r</code>
                    by <code>\n</code> if present).</li>
                  <li>Remove empty lines (replace sequences of the <code>\n</code>
                    character by a single <code>\n</code> character).</li>
                  <li>Calculate the base64-encoded MD5 checksum of the text,
                    remove trailing <code>=</code> characters if any.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> You can also have a look at the Python-based reference
                  implementations to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adstomper/adblockedge/src/89b42f4866c9134480f553ed7ced62795fb0d9e7/validateChecksum.py?at=default">validate

                    a checksum to a file</a>. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <code>! Redirect: http://example.com/list.txt</code> </p>
                <p> This comment indicates that the filter list has moved to a
                  new download address. Adblock Edge will ignore any file
                  contents beyond that comment and immediately try downloading
                  from the new address. In case of success the address of the
                  filter list will be updated in the settings. This comment is
                  ignored if the new address is the same as the current address,
                  meaning that it can be used to enforce the "canonical" address
                  of the filter list. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> <code>! Version: 1234</code> </p>
                <p> This comment defines a numerical version of the filter list.
                  This version number will be displayed in issue reports and can
                  be used to verify that the report refers to the current
                  version of the filter list. </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="advanced">Advanced features</h3>
            <p>The features described in this section are usually used only by
              power users and filterlist creators. Feel free to skip it.</p>
            <h4 id="options">Specifying filter options</h4>
            <p>Adblock Edge allows you to specify a number of options to modify
              the behavior of a filter. You list these options separated with
              commas after a dollar sign ($) at the end of the filter, for
              example:</p>
            <pre>*/ads/*$script,match-case
</pre>
            <p>Here <code>*/ads/*</code> is the actual filter and <code>script</code>
              and <code>match-case</code> are its options. Currently the
              following options are supported:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Type options: determine which types of elements a filter can
                block (or whitelist in case of an exception rule). Multiple type
                options can be specified to indicate that the filter should be
                applied to several types of elements. Possible types are:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>script</code> &#8212; external scripts loaded via HTML
                    script tag</li>
                  <li><code>image</code> &#8212; regular images, typically loaded via
                    HTML img tag</li>
                  <li><code>stylesheet</code> &#8212; external CSS stylesheet files</li>
                  <li><code>object</code> &#8212; content handled by browser plugins,
                    e.g. Flash or Java</li>

                      object</a></li>
                  <li><code>object-subrequest</code> &#8212; requests started plugins
                    like Flash</li>
                  <li><code>subdocument</code> &#8212; embedded pages, usually
                    included via HTML frames</li>
                  <li><code>document</code> &#8212; the page itself (only <a href="Writing%20Adblock%20Edge%20filters.htm#whitelist">exception
                      rules</a> can be applied to the page)</li>
                  <li><code>elemhide</code> &#8212; for exception rules only, similar
                    to <code>document</code> but only disables <a href="Writing%20Adblock%20Edge%20filters.htm#elemhide">element
                      hiding rules</a> on the page rather than all filter rules
                    (Adblock Edge 1.2 and higher required)</li>
                  <li><code>other</code> &#8212; types of requests not covered in the
                    list above</li>
                </ul>
                The type options <code>background</code>, <code>xbl</code>, <code>ping</code>
                and <code>dtd</code> are outdated and should no longer be used.
              </li>
              <li>Inverse type options: specify the element types the filter
                should <strong>not</strong> be applied to. Possible inverse
                type options: <code>~script</code>, <code>~image</code>, <code>~stylesheet</code>,
                <code>~object</code>, <code>~xmlhttprequest</code>, <code>~object-subrequest</code>,
                <code>~subdocument</code>, <code>~document</code>, <code>~elemhide</code>,
                <code>~other</code></li>
              <li>Restriction to third-party/first-party requests: If the <code>third-party</code>
                option is specified, the filter is only applied to requests from
                a different origin than the currently viewed page. Similarly, <code>~third-party</code>
                restricts the filter to requests from the same origin as the
                currently viewed page.</li>
              <li>Domain restrictions: The option <code>domain=example.com</code>
                means that the filter should only be applied on pages from
                "example.com" domain. Multiple domains can be specified using
                "|" as separator: with the option <code>domain=example.com|example.net</code>
                the filter will only be applied on pages from "example.com" or
                "example.net" domains. If a domain name is preceded with "~",
                the filter should <strong>not</strong> be applied on pages from
                this domain. For example, <code>domain=~example.com</code>
                means that the filter should be applied on pages from any domain
                but "example.com" and <code>domain=example.com|~foo.example.com</code>
                restricts the filter to the "example.com" domain with the
                exception of "foo.example.com" subdomain.</li>
              <li><code>match-case</code> &#8212; makes the filter only apply to
                addresses with matching letter case, e.g. the filter <code>*/BannerAd.gif$match-case</code>
                will block <code>http://example.com/BannerAd.gif</code> but not
                <code>http://example.com/bannerad.gif</code>.</li>
              <li><code>collapse</code> &#8212; this option will override the global
                "Hide placeholders of blocked elements" option and make sure the
                filter always hides the element. Similarly the <code>~collapse</code>
                option will make sure the filter never hides the element.</li>
              <li> <code>donottrack</code> &#8212; for any address matching a
                blocking rule with this option and not matching any exception
                rules with this option a <a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do-Not-Track
                  header</a> will be sent (requires Adblock Edge 1.3.5 or
                higher). For backwards compatibility it is recommended to use
                this option in combination with contradicting type options, this
                will prevent this filter from blocking anything in earlier
                Adblock Edge versions: <code>*$donottrack,image,~image</code> </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="regexps">Using regular expressions</h4>
            <p>If you want even more control about what your filters match and
              what they don't match, you can use regular expressions. For
              example the filter <code>/banner\d+/</code> will match <code>banner123</code>
              and <code>banner321</code> but not <code>banners</code>. You can
              check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Regular_Expressions#Writing_a_Regular_Expression_Pattern">documentation
                on regular expressions</a> to learn how to write them.</p>
            <p><em>Note</em>: For performance reasons it is recommended not to
              use regular expressions if they can be avoided.</p>
            <h2 id="elemhide">Element hiding</h2>
            <h3 id="elemhide_basic">Basic rules</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you will find advertisements that can't be blocked
              because they are embedded as text in the web page itself. If you
              look at the source code of the web page you might find something
              like this:</p>
            <pre>&lt;div class="textad"&gt;
Cheapest tofu, only here and now!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="sponsorad"&gt;
Really cheap tofu, click here!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;textad&gt;
Only here you get the best tofu!
&lt;/textad&gt;
</pre>
            <p>You need to download the web page so you will necessarily
              download the advertisements. All you can do here is to hide the
              advertisement so you don't need to see it. That's what element
              hiding is meant for.</p>
            <p>The first advertisement above is contained inside a div element
              with class attribute "textad". The following rule will hide
              exactly this combination: <code>##div.textad</code>. Here ##
              marks an element hiding rule while the rest is a selector
              identifying the elements that need to be hidden. You can hide
              elements by their id attribute similarly, <code>##div#sponsorad</code>
              will hide the second advertisement. You don't need to specify the
              element name, the rule <code>##*#sponsorad</code> will work just
              as well. And you can hide elements by element name only, e.g. <code>##textad</code>
              for the third advertisement.</p>
            <p>The <a hreflang="en" href="https://adblockplus.org/en/elemhidehelper">Element
                Hiding Helper extension</a> helps selecting the correct element
              and writing the corresponding rule without having to view the
              source code of the page. Basic HTML knowledge is useful
              nevertheless.</p>
            <p><em>Note</em>: Element hiding works very differently from normal
              filters. This has the implication that no wildcards are supported
              in element hiding rules.</p>
            <h3 id="elemhide_domains">Limiting rules to certain domains</h3>
            <p>Usually you want to hide a specific ad on one specific site, you
              don't want your rule to be applied on other sites. For example the
              rule <code>##*.sponsor</code> might hide valid code on some
              sites. But if you write it as <code>example.com##*.sponsor</code>
              it will be applied on <code>http://example.com/</code> and <code>http://something.example.com/</code>
              but not on <code>http://example.org/</code>. You can also specify
              multiple domains &#8212; simply separate them with commas: <code>domain1.example,domain2.example,domain3.example##*.sponsor</code>.</p>
            <p>If a domain name is preceded with "~", the rule will <strong>not</strong>
              be applied on pages from this domain (requires Adblock Edge 1.1 or
              higher). For example, <code>~example.com##*.sponsor</code> will
              be be applied on pages from any domain but "example.com" and <code>example.com,~foo.example.com##*.sponsor</code>
              makes the rule apply on "example.com" domain with the exception of
              "foo.example.com" subdomain.</p>
            <p><em>Note</em>: Due to the way how element hiding is implemented,
              you really can only limit it to full domain names. You cannot use
              any other part of the address and you cannot use <code>domain</code>
              as a replacement for <code>domain.example,domain.test</code>.</p>
            <p><em>Note</em>: Element hiding rules with domain limitation can be
              used to hide browser's user interface elements as well. For
              example the filter rule <code>browser##menuitem#javascriptConsole</code>
              will hide the JavaScript Console entry in Firefox's Tools menu.</p>
            <h3 id="elemhide_attributes">Attribute selectors</h3>
            <p>Some advertisers don't make it easy for you &#8212; their text
              advertisements have neither an id nor a class attribute. You can
              use other attributes to hide those, for example <code>##table[width="80%"]</code>
              will hide tables with width attribute set to 80%. If you don't
              want to specify the full value of the attribute, <code>##div[title*="adv"]</code>
              will hide all div elements with title attribute containing the
              string "adv". You can also check the beginning and the end of an
              attribute, for example <code>##div[title^="adv"][title$="ert"]</code>
              will hide div elements with title starting with "adv" and ending
              with "ert". As you see, you can also use multiple conditions &#8212; <code>table[width="80%"][bgcolor="white"]</code>
              will match tables with width attribute set to 80% and bgcolor
              attribute set to white.</p>
            <h3 id="elemhide_css">Advanced selectors</h3>
            <p>In general, any CSS selector supported by Firefox can be used for
              element hiding. For example the following rule will hide anything
              following a div element with class "adheader": <code>##div.adheader
                + *</code>. For a full list of CSS list see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/">W3C
                CSS specification</a> (note that not all selectors are supported
              by Firefox yet).</p>
            <p><em>Note</em>: This functionality is for advanced users only, you
              should be comfortable with CSS selectors to use it. Adblock Edge
              won't be able to check the syntax of the selector you are adding,
              if you use invalid CSS syntax you might break other (valid) rules
              you have. Check JavaScript Console for CSS errors.</p>
            <h3 id="elemhide_exceptions">Exception rules</h3>
            <p> Exception rules can disable existing rules on particular
              domains. These are mostly useful to filter subscription authors
              who are extending another filter subscription that they cannot
              change. For example, the rule <code>##div.textad</code> can be
              disabled on <code>example.com</code> using the exception rule <code>example.com#@#div.textad</code>.
              The combination of these two rules has exactly the same effect as
              the single rule <code>~example.com##div.textad</code>. It is
              recommended that you use exception rules only when you cannot
              change an overly general element hiding rule, in all the other
              cases limiting this rule to the necessary domains is preferable. </p>
            <h3 id="elemhide_simplified">Simplified element hiding syntax</h3>
            <p>Adblock Edge supports simplified element hiding syntax (e.g. <code>#div(id=foo)</code>)
              for backwards compatibility only. Using this syntax is
              discouraged, usual CSS selectors are preferred. Support for this
              syntax might be removed at some point.</p>
