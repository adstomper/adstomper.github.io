            <h2 id="adblocker">What is an adblocker?</h2>
            <p> An adblocker for Chrome or Firefox is an extension (or add-on)
              to your browser, which adds functionality to your browser so it
              can filter content. Adblockers itself have no functionality, in
              the sense that they do not block anything until it is "told" what
              to do. The so-called filterlists tell the adblocker what to block.
              These filterlists, are basically an extensive set of rules, which
              tell Adblock Edge what to block. The lists are created and
              maintained by a large online community.</p>
            <h2 id="block-ads">How to block ads</h2>
            <p> While it can do so much more, the core function of Adblock Edge
              is to block annoying advertisements. These tutorials shows you how
              to block obtrusive ads in the different browsers. </p>
            <h3>How to block ads in Firefox</h3>
            <p> Adblock Edge for Firefox allows you to get rid of all annoying
              advertising, such as YouTube ads, Facebook ads, banners, pop-ups,
              and many others. If you do not have the Mozilla Firefox browser
              installed yet, please <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">install
                it from Mozilla</a>. If you want to block ads in a different
              browser please see the tutorials of installing Adblock Edge for
              Google Chrome and Opera. </p>
            <p> The easiest way to add Adblock Edge to Firefox is to simply <a

                to the Firefox installation page</a> and click on the install
              button. A small screen will open on the left side of your browser,
              please click on "Allow". Then, another small screen will appear,
              where you have to click on "Install now". This will add Adblock
              Edge to your browser, and you will be protected against all
              obtrusive ads. </p>

              Edge in the Mozilla Add-ons section. Then, when you have opened
              the link, the following screen appears: </p>

              from authors whom you trust." please confirm this by clicking on
              "Install". After confirming this, all annoying ads will be
              blocked. </p>

              install Adblock Edge, based on the language of your browser. To
